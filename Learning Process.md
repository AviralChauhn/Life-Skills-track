Answer 1: The Feynmann technique is a learning technique that was introduced by a scientist Feynmann according to him the best way to learn about a topic is to pretend that you are explaining it to somebody else who doesn't have the same base knowledge as you and whenever you feel like you are stuck , you should learn it from the source material and read through it to understand and breakdown any technical term present there.


### Question 2: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Answer 2: Barabara Oakley is an engineering professor who was never very good in maths or science she mentions a very interesting idea that there are two modes of thinking active mode and diffuse mode. She also shared techniques like the Pomodoro technique and testing yourself frequently.

Answer 3: 
- Active mode: This is a mode of learning when we are fully focused on one thing read it without getting distracted and keep our focus on learning one thing.

### Question 5: What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
Answer 5: 
- We should understand deadlines are only meant so I can distribute time equally to every project we should focus on the concept
- Make the concept fun by approaching it with curiosity
- We should be able to write the code in our own words so that when needed we can understand them without any difficulty
- Most importantly we are good at a topic when we can teach it to someone so we should pretend to teach it to someone and correct ourselves whenever needed
- To become successful we should master a few skills very well rather than trying to achieve every possible skill
