# Listening And Assertive Communication

### Question 1: What are the steps/strategies for Active Listening?
Answer 1: 
- Avoid getting distracted by your own thoughts
- We should not interrupt the person in front of us we should let them complete first then speak
- We should take notes of important conversations if appropriate
- We should paraphrase the conversation to make sure both we and the speaker are on the same page
- We should use phrases that show we are listening and interested in knowing more to open new doors for conversation
- We should show we are listening through body language, for example, nodding wherever needed, etc.

### Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?
Answer 2: Reflective listening is about showing that you're listening and trying to understand the other person. This model consists of the following:
   - Repeating: You could repeat what the other person said in your own words. It shows you're paying attention.
   - Paraphrasing: Put their words differently. It helps them feel heard and understood.
   - Clarifying: Ask questions to make sure you get it right. This shows you want to understand them     better.
   - Summarizing: Wrap up what they said. It helps them see you're following their thoughts.

### Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?
Answer 3: 
- Getting distracted when someone is talking which can divert our focus from what we are listening to.
- Lack of patience: we wait for the person in front of us to finish before we start speaking about it
- Assumption: we should wait and listen to the speaker before forming any opinion on it

### Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?
Answer 4:
- We can try to focus on what the speaker is saying without getting distracted
- We can also wait for the speaker to finish so we don't interrupt him
- We can paraphrase what the speaker said to understand it more clearly and make sure that the idea is forwarded clearly

### Question 5: When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?
Answer 5: Passive communication is when a person is hesitant to express their feelings main reasons for using passive communication are:
- Avoiding conflict: when a situation occurs where our views and opinions are not the same then we use passive communication to avoid further discussion
- Fear of rejection: In many cases when we need something most of the time due to the fear of rejection we use passive communication
- Lack of Confidence: When we have to present our opinions in front of a group of people due to lack of confidence we use passive communication and accept their views without expressing ours

### Question 6: When do you switch to Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?
Answer 6:  Most of the time when things become repetitive and suppressing our needs and opinions becomes a regular thing these are some instances when a person loses the ability to communicate passively and switches to aggressive communication

### Question 7: When do you switch to passive-aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?
Answer 7: We people use passive-aggressive communication, like sarcasm or staying quiet, when we find it hard to talk openly or worry about negative reactions. This indirect way can happen because of power issues, hidden frustration, or trouble speaking up. While it lets out frustration, it can also harm relationships and make communication tricky. Talking openly and dealing with problems directly is better for understanding each other. If we often uses passive-aggressive ways, getting support or finding better ways to communicate can help.

### Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive? You can watch and analyze the videos, then think about what would be a few steps you can apply in your own life.
Answer 8: 
- Be Clear and Specific: Clearly articulate our needs, wants, or concerns to avoid misunderstandings. Provide specific details to enhance clarity.
- Maintain Calm Confidence: Speak with a firm and steady voice, maintaining calmness even in challenging situations. Confidence in our communication helps convey our message effectively.
- Active Listening: Demonstrate that we value others' input by actively listening, and responding thoughtfully. This fosters mutual understanding and promotes positive communication.
- Acknowledge and Accept Feedback: We should be open to feedback and willing to adjust our communication style based on constructive input.
