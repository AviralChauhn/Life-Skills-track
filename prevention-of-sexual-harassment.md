# Prevention Of Sexual Harassment

### Kinds of behavior that cause sexual harassment
It's crucial to realize that sexual harassment can take many different forms and is not just limited to overt physical acts. The following behaviors have been shown to be associated with sexual harassment:

- Unwanted Sexual Comments or Advances: Sexual harassment can be defined as inappropriate remarks, gestures, or approaches that are not appreciated by the target of the harassment.

- Unwanted Touching: Sexual harassment can be defined as any physical interaction, including touching, grabbing, or patting, that occurs without the explicit and voluntary agreement of the other party.

- Sexualized Jokes or Comments: Making sexual jokes or remarks that incite hostility or discomfort can be a contributing factor to sexual harassment.

- Unwanted Attention or Stalking: Sexual harassment occurs when someone is subjected to persistently unwelcome attention, followed, or observed in their activities. This can foster an environment of dread and discomfort.


### Steps To be taken in case of repeated experiences

If such incidents occur repeatedly then, it's important to take appropriate steps to address the situation. Here are some recommended actions:

- Record the Incident: Make a note of all the information, such as the date, time, place, and people involved. Note any pertinent details on the behavior, such as remarks made specifically, actions taken, or the presence of any witnesses.

- Report the occurrence: Report the occurrence to the relevant authority in your organization, if you feel safe doing so. This could be a designated individual in charge of managing such matters, human resources, or a supervisor. Observe the policies set forth by your company for reporting and dealing with harassment.

- Urge Eyewitnesses to Report Crimes:  Encourage any witnesses to the incident to give their account of what transpired. Their remarks may be helpful in handling the circumstances.

- Recognize Your Rights: Know your rights when it comes to harassment at work. There are laws and regulations in existence in many nations and organizations that specifically protect people from harassment.
